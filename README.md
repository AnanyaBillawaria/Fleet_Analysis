# Fleet Management  

This project analyzes fleet performance using **Power BI dashboards**, focusing on vehicle types, fuel usage, mileage efficiency (MPG), and distance covered. The aim is to provide actionable insights for optimizing fleet operations and fuel management.

## Objectives  
- Track vehicle distribution by type and fleet  
- Compare **fuel usage** and **miles-per-gallon (MPG)** across fuel types  
- Analyze **average distance run** by vehicle categories  
- Identify efficiency trends at the vehicle and fleet level  

---

## Dataset & Metrics  
- **Fleet Data** â€“ includes vehicle ID, fleet assignment, fuel type, MPG, and distance run  
- **KPIs Analyzed:**  
  - Count of vehicles  
  - Fuel consumption by vehicle & fleet  
  - Average MPG by year & fuel type  
  - Average distance run by vehicle  

---

## Key Insights  
- **Fuel Type Efficiency:** Diesel-powered vehicles dominated the fleet (~96%), with higher MPG compared to gasoline.  
- **Vehicle Type Performance:**  
  - Vans and welfare buses showed moderate distance run but lower MPG efficiency.  
  - Large tippers and tankers consumed disproportionately higher fuel.  
- **Fleet-Level Variations:** Significant differences in distance run and MPG across fleets, suggesting scope for optimization.  
- **Trend Analysis:** Overall MPG has been relatively stable (~25 MPG average), with slight improvements in recent years.

## Tools  
- Power BI (primary dashboards)  
- Python (optional preprocessing)  
  - pandas, numpy, matplotlib  

---

## Future Work  
- Build a **predictive model** to estimate fuel needs and maintenance costs  
- Create alerts for **underperforming vehicles**  
- Integrate external data (e.g., fuel prices, routes) for richer analysis  
- Develop an interactive **dashboard for fleet managers**
